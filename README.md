# FaceDetectionVideoTool
This repository contains a Python script for detecting faces in real-time video streams. Using the power of the OpenCV library, this tool analyzes every frame of the video, detects faces using the Haar Cascade algorithm and displays the results by drawing rectangles around the detected faces.
